# react-movie-app
In this React movie app, I am going to:

- Use a real API to search for movies as we type

- Create a "Netflix style" horizontal scroll effect

- Add movies to and remove them from our favourites

- Save our favourites to local storage to they appear when the app refreshes

- Finally handle with broken images which response as a null.
